        Hi there! I'm Stephen and I offered BSc. Chemistry at University of Ghana.
        Although I studied Chemistry as my major, I have always being passionate about technology.
        I will describe myself as a maker constantly seeking solution to challenges.

        with electronic devices. In this project, my role is to design a prototype
        of an Internet of Things (I.o.T) device that will send information about silo
        conditions including humidity and temperature to this website.

        When i'm not volunteering for events, or coding you will probably find me geeking on
        latest news from silicon valley, or building some system. My role on this project was to
        integrate all component systems, including the database and qr reading and creating systems.
